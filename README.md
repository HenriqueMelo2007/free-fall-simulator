# Free Fall Simulator

The project is a simple Python program that simulates the free fall of an object from a given initial height. The user is prompted to input the initial height in meters, and the program calculates and prints the height of the object at each second until it hits the ground. The simulation assumes a constant gravitational acceleration of 10 m/sÂ². The output includes the time in seconds and the corresponding height of the object in meters at each step of the simulation.
